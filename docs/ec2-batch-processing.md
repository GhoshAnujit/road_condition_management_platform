# EC2 Batch Processing for Road Metrics AI

This document outlines the implementation of batch processing capabilities using AWS EC2 for the Road Metrics AI platform.

## Overview

The batch processing system is designed to handle computationally intensive tasks that are not suitable for serverless functions, such as:

- Daily aggregation of road defect data
- Generation of statistical reports
- Processing of historical data for trend analysis
- Creation of heatmap data for visualization

## Architecture

![Batch Processing Architecture](images/batch-processing-architecture.png)

The batch processing architecture consists of:

1. **EC2 Instance**: t3.medium instance running Amazon Linux 2
2. **S3 Bucket**: For storing processed data and reports
3. **RDS Database**: Shared with the main application
4. **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging
5. **IAM Roles**: For secure access to AWS resources

## Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure is defined using Terraform in the `infrastructure/terraform/ec2_batch.tf` file. This ensures:

- Reproducible infrastructure
- Version-controlled configuration
- Easy updates and modifications

Key components defined in Terraform:
- EC2 instance with appropriate sizing
- Security groups for network access
- IAM roles and policies
- CloudWatch alarms for monitoring

## Batch Processing Scripts

The main batch processing script is located at `infrastructure/scripts/batch/data_aggregation.py`. This Python script:

1. Connects to the RDS database
2. Retrieves defect data for a specific time period
3. Performs statistical analysis
4. Stores results in both S3 and the database
5. Logs activities for monitoring

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed locally
- Access to the application's database

### Deployment Steps

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review the Terraform Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Configure the EC2 Instance**:
   After the EC2 instance is created, SSH into it and run:
   ```bash
   # Copy the setup script to the instance
   scp -i your-key.pem infrastructure/scripts/batch/setup_ec2.sh ec2-user@<EC2_IP>:~/
   
   # Copy the batch processing script
   scp -i your-key.pem infrastructure/scripts/batch/data_aggregation.py ec2-user@<EC2_IP>:~/
   
   # SSH into the instance
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2_IP>
   
   # Run the setup script
   bash setup_ec2.sh
   
   # Update the environment configuration with actual values
   nano /opt/road-metrics/config/batch.env
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Test the batch script manually
   cd /opt/road-metrics/batch
   python3 data_aggregation.py --date 2023-11-01
   
   # Check the logs
   cat /opt/road-metrics/logs/batch.log
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### CloudWatch Monitoring

The EC2 instance is configured with CloudWatch for:
- CPU, memory, and disk utilization metrics
- Log collection from batch processing scripts
- Alarms for high resource utilization

### Maintenance Tasks

Regular maintenance should include:
1. Reviewing CloudWatch logs for errors
2. Updating Python dependencies
3. Checking S3 storage usage
4. Reviewing and optimizing batch processing scripts

## Scaling Considerations

As data volume grows, consider:

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Increase EC2 instance size for more CPU/memory
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Implement multiple EC2 instances with a job queue
3. **Scheduled Scaling**: Use EC2 Auto Scaling to adjust capacity based on schedule
4. **Serverless Options**: For some tasks, consider migrating to AWS Batch or Step Functions

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security measures:

1. **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access to AWS resources
2. **Security Groups**: Restricted network access
3. **Encrypted Storage**: Data encrypted at rest
4. **Secure Configuration**: Sensitive information stored in environment variables

## Cost Optimization

To optimize costs:

1. Use Spot Instances for non-critical batch jobs
2. Schedule EC2 instances to run only when needed
3. Monitor and adjust instance size based on actual usage
4. Set up budget alerts to monitor spending

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. Implement AWS Batch for more complex job scheduling
2. Add data validation and quality checks
3. Implement machine learning for predictive analytics
4. Create a web dashboard for batch job monitoring
