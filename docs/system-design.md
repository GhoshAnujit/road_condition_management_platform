# Road Metrics AI - System Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the system design for Road Metrics AI, a platform that provides AI-driven road condition assessment and management solutions using smartphone video data, computer vision, and GIS integrations.

### 1.2 Scope
The system allows users to:
- View an interactive map of road defects
- Report new defects by clicking on the map
- View analytics and statistics about road conditions
- Upload external road condition data through an API

### 1.3 Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Mapbox GL, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, GeoAlchemy2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, EC2, RDS)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Entity Relationship Diagram

```
+----------------+       +----------------+
|     User       |       |     Defect     |
+----------------+       +----------------+
| id             |       | id             |
| email          |       | defect_type    |
| hashed_password|       | severity       |
| full_name      |       | latitude       |
| is_active      |       | longitude      |
| is_admin       |       | location (geo) |
| created_at     |<----->| notes          |
| updated_at     |       | reported_at    |
+----------------+       | updated_at     |
                         | reported_by    |
                         +----------------+
```

### 3.2 Database Schema

#### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(255),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

#### Defects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE defects (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    defect_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    severity VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    latitude FLOAT NOT NULL,
    longitude FLOAT NOT NULL,
    location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    reported_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    reported_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create spatial index
CREATE INDEX defects_location_idx ON defects USING GIST (location);
```

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 Endpoints

- `POST /api/defects` - Create a new defect
- `GET /api/defects/{defect_id}` - Get a specific defect
- `PUT /api/defects/{defect_id}` - Update a defect
- `DELETE /api/defects/{defect_id}` - Delete a defect
- `POST /api/defects/upload` - Upload external defect data
- `GET /api/defects/statistics/summary` - Get defect statistics

#### Users
